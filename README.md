- **Future Weather Forecast**:
  - Provides weather forecasts for multiple days, with detailed information on each day's weather conditions.
- **Customizable Weather Data Display**:
  - Weather data is presented in a user-friendly list format, with corresponding weather icons for easy understanding.
- **City Selection**:
  - Users can select and switch between different cities to view their weather forecasts.
- **Automatic Location Detection**:
  - The app uses GPS or network services to automatically determine the user's location and display the corresponding weather forecast.
- **Additional Functionalities**:
  - **Music Player Plugin**: Allows users to play songs stored on their SD card or online.
  - **Calendar Plugin**: Displays dates by day, week, or month, and allows users to add, delete, or modify events.

## Technical Stack
